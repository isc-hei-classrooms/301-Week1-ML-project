## Business Question
The company wants to understand how different home characteristics influence market prices. The goals are twofold: (1) develop a predictive model that estimates the selling price of a home, and (2) provide actionable insights to clients on which features or improvements can most effectively increase their home’s value.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (1)

::: columns
::: column
![](output/distrib_price.png){fig-alt="Distribution of housing prices" width=100%}
:::

::: column
The distribution of housing prices is highly skewed, with most properties concentrated around mid-range values (100,000–300,000).
This means that the model will be more accurate in this central range, where it has many examples to learn from.
However, for very expensive properties, which are rare in the dataset, the model will struggle more, as these outliers are underrepresented.
:::
:::

## Exploratory Data Analysis (2)

::: columns
::: column
![](output/correlation.png){fig-alt="Reduced correlation matrix of housing features" width=100%}
:::

::: column
The reduced correlation matrix highlights that housing prices are strongly correlated with variables such as material quality, living area, basement size, kitchen quality, and the number of garages. These features are therefore key drivers of price. On the other hand, variables like the number of kitchens, the sale year, or the overall quality score show little to no correlation with price, suggesting they bring limited predictive power.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (3)

::: columns
::: column
![](output/linear.png){fig-alt="Scatter plot of price vs living area" width=100%}
:::

::: column
The relationship between housing price and key variables is generally linear. For example, as the living area increases, the price tends to rise proportionally. While some extreme cases deviate from this trend, most properties follow a clear linear pattern, which supports the use of regression-based models.
:::
:::

## Modelling
Based on the exploratory data analysis, a regression model was selected as the most appropriate starting point, since the relationships between key variables and housing prices were mostly linear.
However, due to correlations between predictors (e.g. living area and basement size), a simple linear regression could lead to instability and overfitting.
To address this, we applied an Elastic Net regression, which combines the strengths of Ridge (stability) and Lasso (feature selection).
This approach ensures that the model remains both accurate and interpretable, focusing on the most relevant predictors.

## Model Performance and Validatation (1)

**Top contributing features (Elastic Net)**

| Feature                  | Coefficient |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Living area (surf_hab)    | +20,425     |
| Material quality          | +16,940     |
| Expensive × surface       | +14,878     |
| Basement area             | +14,167     |
| Kitchen quality           | +11,562     |
| Building type: row house  | −8,552      |
| Building type: individual | +7,634      |
| Flat roof                 | +6,851      |
| Garage capacity           | +5,771      |

*Interpretation*: Larger living areas, better materials, and higher kitchen quality strongly increase the price, while some building types (e.g. row houses) decrease it.

**Model performance (full dataset)**

| Metric | Value   |
|--------|---------|
| R²     | 0.861   |
| RMSE   | 26,471  |
| MAE    | 19,419  |

*Interpretation*:  
- The model explains ~86% of price variability.  
- Average error is about **19k**, which is reasonable compared to the typical price range.

## Model Performance and Validatation (2)

::: columns
::: column
![](output/residus.png){fig-alt="Residual plot of predicted vs actual prices" width=100%}
:::

::: column
This residual plot shows the difference between predicted and actual prices across the dataset. Most predictions (blue points) are centered close to zero, indicating good overall performance. However, for houses identified as high-end (red points), the model systematically underestimates the price. This suggests that the model captures mid-range properties well but struggles with luxury homes, which are less represented in the data.

## Business Conclusions and Next Steps
The analysis highlights that certain features, such as kitchen quality and garage capacity, have a strong impact on property prices. This means that advising clients to improve the quality of their kitchen or to expand their garage could significantly increase the resale value of their homes.

At the same time, the model currently performs best on mid-range properties and has more difficulty capturing the dynamics of very expensive homes. With more data and further refinement, the model could be improved to better identify the drivers of high-end properties, making predictions more reliable across the entire market.
